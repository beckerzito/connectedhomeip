name: 202.2.4. [TC-OVENOPSTATE-2.4] Mandatory Events with DUT as Server

PICS:

config:

    cluster: "Oven Cavity Operational State"
    endpoint: 1

    - label:
          "Step 3: At the DUT take the vendor defined action to generate an
          OperationalError event"
      PICS: OVENOPSTATE.S.E00 && PICS_SKIP_SAMPLE_APP
      verification: |
          After the subscription interval via the TH (chip-tool) verify:
          - reception of an OperationalError Event
          - ErrorStateID is a defined error
          - If the ErrorStateID is manufacturer specific, inclusion of an ErrorStateLabel, not present otherwise
          - Optionally an ErrorStateDetails

          NOTE : There's a PIXIT value controlling the ability to execute that ({PIXIT_ERROREVENTGEN}), which as the test case notes, requires vendor specific actions to generated the error at the DUT.  This is dependent on the vendor app supporting this.  The SDK as it stands won't provide the error, this may be testable by some of the vendors depending on their implementations.
